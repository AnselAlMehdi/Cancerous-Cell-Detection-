        "In this project, imagine that your colleague, an oncologist (cancer doctor), is working in a major hospital that specializes in treating breast cancers. Breast cancer tumors are very complicated at the cellular level, and this makes determining whether a patient's tumor is malignant (dangerous) or benign (not dangerous) a challenge. Your task will be to build a classifier that can determine whether a sample is malignant or benign to help your colleague!\n",
        "\n",
        "Every patient that arrives at the hospital undergoes a biopsy of their tumor. This means that a small sample of the tumor is taken from the patient and various metrics are recorded about it, including: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. \n",
        "\n",
        "Using a large dataset of labeled biopsy samples from breast cancer tumors, you will build your binary classification model to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on these features. Then, this model can help you to better determine diagnoses for new patients who arrive at the hospital.\n"
